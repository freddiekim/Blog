Apple Special Event at Steve Jobs Theater,Cupertino
There's lot of ways to be as a person.
And some people express their deep appreciation in different ways.
But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation
to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there.
And you never meet the people,you never shake their hands, you never hear their stoy or tell
yours. but somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something's transmitted there.
And it's a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation.
So we need to be true to who we are and remember what's really important to us.
that's what's going to keep
Apple, Apple, is if we keep us, us.

I love hearing his voice and his inspiring message.
it was only fitting that steve should open his theater.

It is the honor of a lifetime to be the first to welcome you to the Steve Jobs Theater.

Steave meant too much to me and so much to all of us.

There's not a day that goes by that we don't think about him.
Memories have especially come rushing back as we prepared for today this event.

It's taken some time that we can now reflect on him with joy instead of sadness.
Steve's spirit and timeless philosophy on life will always be the DNA of Apple.

His greatesst gift, his greatest expression of his aprreciation for humanity would not be a
singular product, but rather it would be Apple itself.
We dedicate this theater to Steve because we loved him and because he loved days like this where he could share
our latest new products and new ideas in the world. and we do so not only to pay tribute to Steve but to inspire the
next generation of creators and innovators.

Steve was a genius and one of many ~  that was in his uncanny ability to unlock the telent of everybody that he worked him.

He thought deeply about our workplace and its surroundings. And he believed that they should inspire talented people to do their best work.so over a decade ago, he began to work on a new campus for apple.

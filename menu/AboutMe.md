title: About Me

---

My name is freddie.

I am interested in many things such as machine learning, radar signal processing algorithms, writing clean coding and development processing.

I don't want to be interested in one thing.

I want to be studying the different topic what I am interested in at that time.

I am going to leave a trace about my learning here. It may or may not be helpful for many people visiting my blog.
however I will try to make this blog a precious space for me.
